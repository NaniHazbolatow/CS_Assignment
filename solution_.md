## The neurocognitive effects of alcohol on adolescents and college students
#### Ernani Hazbolatow (14272210)

The importance of the paper by Ziegler [1] is underscored by the rising prevalance of alcohol use in addition to the growing WO student population in the Netherlands. When both are plotted against each other, a correlation is observed between the two. Although a correlation is present, not much can be said about whether the rise in alcohol use is mostly observed among Dutch students or another segment of the Dutch population.
